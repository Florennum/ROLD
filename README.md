# ROLD
hello there!
This is ROLD(Roblox on Linux Dispatcher)!
# Why to use
If you are a newbie or want to automate some tasks regarding Vinegar/Grapejuice you can use ROLD!

What does it do you may ask.

For now it has an automatic WineGE installer and Wayland cursor patcher using gamescope, tho I will implement more features later on.
# How do I install it?
First we need to install the [dependencies](https://github.com/Florennum/rold/blob/main/DEPENDANCIES.md).
Then we gotta clone the repository and go inside it with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Florennum/ROLD.git
cd rold
```
Then we simply compile by using compile.sh
```sh
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```
Oh wow! rold_beta appeared out of nowhere! And now we simply execute it in the way we want!

Doing `./rold_beta --vinegar --download-ge` will install WineGE for source Vinegar for example.

All of the available options can be listed with `./rold_beta -h`.
